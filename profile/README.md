## Who We Are

- **Greg Herlein** — With 40+ years of software experience at companies like Cisco and AWS, Greg brings a wealth of technical depth and operational excellence. His early career as a nuclear reactor operator aboard the USS *Richard B. Russell* instilled in him a mindset of rigor, precision, and reliability that now shapes our engineering culture.  

- **Luca Herlein** — Luca earned his Aerospace Engineering degree from CU Boulder, where he led aerodynamics on the university’s Design/Build/Fly team. He has spent his early career in software development while pursuing robotics at every stage of life, from FIRST Lego League and VEX Robotics to advanced multirotor and fixed-wing drone design. He now also leads externally facing AI initiatives at his company, helping customers bring AI into their hardware products.  

Together, we form a unique blend of **software, aerospace, robotics, and AI expertise**, ready to push consumer robotics forward.

## Our Vision

Herlein Robotics exists to create **world-class, consumer-ready robots** that are not just impressive prototypes, but useful companions in everyday life. We believe the next generation of robotics will be:  

- **AI-first** — tightly integrated with modern inference models.  
- **Accessible** — designed for real people, not just labs.  
- **Robust** — engineered with aerospace-grade rigor and reliability.

## Our Journey

We are a **self-funded startup** still in the process of finding our first flagship product. Our projects span:  

- Experimental robot designs powered by embedded AI.  
- Drone and mobility platforms for applied robotics research.  
- Human-robot interfaces that make robotics approachable and intuitive.

## Why We’re Different

Our strength lies in combining **deep industry experience** with the **hands-on, experimental mindset of makers and engineers**. We’re not afraid to build, test, fail, and rebuild — and we bring together decades of expertise in software, aerospace, and robotics to move faster and smarter than most early-stage teams.
